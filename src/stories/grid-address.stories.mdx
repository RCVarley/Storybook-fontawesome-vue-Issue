# GridAddress

Contains an address, specifically designed for placing onto a grid.

## Default

The default grid item allows you to `edit`, `delete` and `select` an address.  Each of these
actions causes the component to emit the edit the one of these key words with the `addressId` as an argument.

<Canvas>
  <Story 
    name="Default"
    args={{
      address: someAddress,
      isReadonly: false,
      isSelected: false,
      }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Default"/>

## Selected

If an address has been selected, as well as altering the overall styling,
then it will disable the `delete` button and replace the `select` button
with an indication that it has been selected.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Selected" args={{
    address: someAddress,
    isSelected: true,
    isReadonly: false,
  }}>
  {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Selected"/>

## Readonly

If you don't want the user to be able to change any of these values
then you can set the `is-readonly` property to `true`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Readonly" args={{
    address: someAddress,
    isSelected: false,
    isReadonly: true,
  }}>
  {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Readonly"/>
